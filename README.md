## Concept
The Player wakes up on a deserted island surrounded by a sea of clouds and needs to do whatever is necessary to survive and escape. Sounds simple? Well... it would be simple... if it were not for the unforgiving elements...
From different seasons to the pure simplicity of hunger and a need to keep your nutritional values in check, try to survive as the world tries to kill you in every way possible and evolve to face new and different challenges has you progress through the ages parallel to what humanity faced during its evolution!
## Target
Android 4.1 or superior
## Main Game Mechanics
The Game is split into different ages (conceptually or implemented into the game, needs to be defined) and in each the player faces a slightly different challenge. To progress through the ages the Player needs to do research which in the beginning costs much-needed time and by the end the player needs to automate its research which costs different items and requires him to develop intricate automation systems.
### First Age
The player wakes up in a hostile world and needs to scavenge in order to keep its hunger and water supplies in check. The world also has a climate system that may force the player to take measures to protect himself against the elements like rain or the cold nights... In this age the Player needs to craft simple tools in order to improve the quantity of the items scavenged as well as to have access to different new resources.
### Second Age
You just found the power of agriculture and how to start to change the world in your benefit! In this age you have more time to do research and you don't need to pay as much attention to the food and water bars... Or at least you thought so... Beware of the summer and winter as they are unforgiving each for their own specific reasons... The amount of resources available drops and you need to give each season its own thought and careful planing.
### Third Age
The world is huge and you have been stuck in this tiny little island for far too long... Time to sail off and explore the rest of the world in search of new resources...
### Fourth Age
You start to get comfy whit your coal powered machines and it's the start of a brand-new chapter, one where you don't need to do all the tasks... And survival is a thing of the past!!
### Fifth Age
Turns out there is a better way to power all your machines that doesn't involve you to tirelessly fill them up whit coal... The dawn of electricity allows you to make better and faster machines and also to automate your research.
### Sixth Age
Prepare to escape from the planet and finish your journey!
## Design
The game is designed to use a low poly approach and a hexagonal tile system
