## Main Game Mechanics
The Game is split into different ages (conceptually or implemented into the game, needs to be defined) and in each the player faces a slightly different challenge. To progress through the ages the Player needs to do research which in the beggining costs much needed time and by the end the player needs to automate its research which costs different items and requires him to develop intricate automation systems.
### First Age
The player wakes up in an hostile world and needs to scavenge in order to keep its hunger and water supplies in check. The world also has a climate system that may force the player to take measures to protect himself against the elements like rain or the cold nights... In this age the Player needs to craft simple tools in order to improve the quantity of the items scavanged as well as to have access to different new resources.
